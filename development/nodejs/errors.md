# Error Handling

## Error definitions

- All errors should be gathered into one configuration file.
- Every error gets a unique code assigned.

```typescript
import { errors as defaults, ErrorType } from '@tree-house/errors';

// Needed to enforce type and keep IDE autocompletion
const asType = <T extends { [key: string]: ErrorType }>(arg: T): T => arg;

export const ERRORS = asType({
  ...defaults,
  ...{
    urlNotFound: {
      code: 'URL_NOT_FOUND',
      message: 'The requested route does not exist',
    },
  },
});
```

## Blocking errors

- Express routes should be wrapped with try/catch to avoid unhandled errors.
- Throw errors when the flow will always get interrupted.
- Required to mention in JSDocs since Typescript has no support for declaring errors being thrown within functions.
  This only applies for user defined errors such as illustrated below.
  Itâ€™s impossible and not needed to define all possible third-party errors being thrown.

```typescript
/**
 * Returns an existing user by id.
 * @param {string} id - User identifier.
 * @throws {NotFoundError} - User could not be found by its id.
 */
const getUserById = async (id: string): Promise<IUser> => {
  const user = await userRepository.getById(id);
  if (!user) {
    throw new NotFoundError(ERRORS.userNotFound);
  }
  return user;
};
```

## Non-blocking errors

- When we need to keep track of errors occurring within the flow without interruption.
- Could be needed when processing multiple documents without throwing in between.

```javascript
const { data, errors } = await BPromise.safe(products.map((product) => getTotals(product)));
```

> Utility `BPromise.safe` will execute multiple promises and keep track of errors returning them at the end of execution.
