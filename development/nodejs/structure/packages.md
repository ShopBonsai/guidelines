# Packages

All the files are examples to demonstrate the structure. They aren't required in every package!

## Notes

These files are in addition to the structure laid out in [Common](https://coda.io/d/Development-Guidelines_d7DszrlIOzU/Common_suim9).

## Services

### index.ts

- Exports methods, types and classes from the package.
- Exposed Methods

  - We need to ensure that exposed methods are exported properly, and that a mistake further down the line wonâ€™t break the method being exposed.
  - We should absolutely have tests for exported methods, but we could also use a tool similar to [api-extractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/api-extractor) in order to be absolutely sure our exported methods are working.

  ```javascript
  import { IStoreConfig, IEciConfig, IPreCheckoutInput } from './interfaces';
  import { ApiRequest } from './lib/request';
  import { getOrderEmail } from './services/marketplace';
  import { importProducts, onboardProducts } from './services/merchant';

  export * from './interfaces';
  export { supportedIntegrations } from './constants';

  /**
   * Returns new ECI client.
   * @param {object} config - E-Commerce integration configuration (Magento-eci, Shopify-eci).
   */
  export const getEciClient = (config: IEciConfig) => (storeConfig: IStoreConfig) =>
    new EciClient(config, storeConfig);
  ```
